On Registration - When an account is created, the username, password, and email of the user is stored on the server.  
<br />
<br />
While Playing - Information related to the user's play (high scores, best games, etc.) is sent and stored on the server.  The user is able to see all of this information in the High Scores Screen.
<br />
<br />

Information Use:
Username and passwords of users are only stored on the server and used for authentication purposes.  Email is stored and used as a means of emailing users if they need to reset their password.  Information about the user's total score over time is used in order to populate the high score leader board in the high score screen along with all other users of the system.  Other statistical information is used only to show these items to the user in the High Scores Screen.  Besides the developers and the user, no other third party has access to this information.
<br />
